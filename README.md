## Request for Proposal
RFP of the project can be seen [here](https://github.com/Rohitreddz/Topic-of-the-Day/blob/main/rfp.md)


## Proposed Stack For The Project:   
* Programming Languages :   
  1. Java
* Libraries & Frameworks   
  1. Frontend
      * CSS
      * BootStrap( For responsive design)
      * Angular
  2. Backend

  3. Hosting platform
      * Heroku
  4. Data Host & Type
      * Heroku PostgreSQL
  5. Front-end page plan :
      * Server-side views


## Stack Used for Developing:
1)We intend to use Java as the backend language with SpringBoot as the Framework, as it facilitates to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications.

2)We used Heroku as backend free app host, as it enables to host our code in various languages relatively easily and the add-ons have always been very reliable and easy to install.
3)We are planning to use Heroku PostgreSQL as Database by connecting the Heroku to the PostgreSQL. We have acheived this by installing Heroku PostgreSQL plugin.

4)We propose to create the application using Angular on the front end. It offers various features linke Dependency Injection ,two way data binding that help to scale, optimize, and speed up the application across the platforms. 

5)We are planning to use Bootstrap for Front-end responsive design.
